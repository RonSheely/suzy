//! Suzy's watch system provides the main way to define functionality within
//! the framework.  It enables you to describe the relationships between
//! widgets in a declaritive way.
//!
//! The watch system is based off an "automatic" observer pattern, inspired
//! by Kivy's "[Kv Language](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/lang.html)".
//!
//! Inside a "watch" closure, Suzy tracks which values are accessed at
//! runtime and automatically binds to them.  The closure is re-run when
//! the bound values change.
//!
//! The watch system is defined in terms of relationships between two API
//! surfaces: [`Watched`] represents some data which will
//! be interesting to observe, and
//! [`Desc::watch`](crate::widget::Desc::watch)
//! is used to submit a closure which observes values.
//!
//! Other utilities for less common situations are provided in this module.
//!
//! # Examples
//! Place a fixed sized button at the bottom-left of a custom widget, with
//! a small amount of padding.  Because the layout instructions are included
//! in a closure submitted to `watch`, whenever the position of the Widget
//! `MyWidgetData` changes, the closure will be re-run and the position of the
//! button will be updated to match.
//!
