//! A flexible interface for the low-level aspects of the GUI system.
//!
//! One render platform is currently included, based on OpenGL ES 2.0
//!
//! Two windowing platforms are currently included; the primary is based on
//! SDL2.  A windowless OSMesa interface is also included, intended for
//! automated testing.
//!
//! If no platforms are enabled (using features) the default platform is
//! a "stub" platform which has no functionality (all methods panic).
